                    <button class="faq-question">Do you accept insurance? What are the costs?</button>
                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>We accept debit cards, credit cards, HSA cards, and Flex Spending accounts. We are considered out-of-network for most insurance plans (as are most specialized therapists), but many insurance plans offer full or majority reimbursement for therapy services.

                            Our staff is happy to provide questions to ask your insurance provider about any insurance benefits you may have and how you may be able to get reimbursed for your therapy fees. The most common way is to submit a super bill to your insurance provider and they will reimburse you. We can guide you every step of the way.
                            
                            Our fees range depending on which therapist you choose. The range for a standard 50-minute session is $210-$235.
                            Please give us a call (408-539-6128 or text (408-539-6128. The friendly care coordinators at Silicon Valley Therapy would be happy to learn more about your needs and answer any additional questions you may have.</p>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>We strive to provide exceptional care while respecting the time of both our clients and therapists. If you would like to cancel or reschedule your appointment, please provide 48 hours’ notice. You can contact your therapist directly or call us. Appointments that are cancelled with less than 48 hours notice will be subject to the full session fee. We understand that life can throw curveballs, and we’re willing to review individual cases where the fee might be waived.</p>

                    <button class="faq-question">How long does therapy usually last?</button>
                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>This answer depends greatly on your goals, particular situation, how much effort you put in, and your appointments’ frequency. Starting on a once-a-week cadence can help accelerate and hold you accountable for reaching your goals promptly. Research shows that when clients fully engage in therapy by regularly doing homework, focusing in the sessions, and implementing the taught skills, they feel they meet their goals quickly. In some instances, we have been able to be helpful in as few as four sessions. In contrast, other times, clients have continued with us for much longer, with an average of around 12-15 sessions. Although it is difficult to predict exactly how many appointments you will need upfront, your therapist would be happy to discuss this with you as your therapy gets underway.</p>
